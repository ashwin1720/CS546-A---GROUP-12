## Usage 

- The plight an author goes through when he intends to go through a traditional publishing company is tremendous and unimaginable. An author often loses the power to decide titles, covers, and marketing angles and must compromise and go with the suggestions made by the publishing company. So, we aim to create a website which is based on the concept ofonline bookstore. Once the author signs up, it will redirect to the Author's Index page where they can add a book along with the name of the book, price,description, number of pages, Author's details and category. In the customer page, the books which have been added by the authors will be available for all the customers to purchase. Even though the customer pays for the book he/she will be restricted from downloading it. Also, customers will have a facility to add reviews and ratings.

### Process
1. Go to the landing page
2. Create an account as Author
3. Login as Author 
4. Go to Add new book page and add a pdf version of the book with all details
5. Sign up and Sign in as Customer.
6. Search for all the books added by Authors.
7. A customer can either read the sample(upto 10 pages) or can buy the book.
8. All the books bougth by the customer can be found by clicking on My books option.
9. Once customer buys,they can rate and review the book
